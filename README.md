# My Personal Website

My personal portfolio website designed to be simplistic and clean. This is a first try of making websites.

## Tech Stack

I have used HTML and Tailwindcss for this website.

## Getting Started

1. Install Dependencies: `npm install`
2. Active Tailwindcss: `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch`
Then you must choose a option Open In Live Server.
